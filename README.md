[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/dotfiles/pulls)

Repository for holding all of my dotfiles.

:construction_worker: _WIP_ :construction_worker:

## Disclaimer

> _"What is working for me might not work for you...use your common sense before executing any of these files!"_

## Don't forget too...

1. Run installation script for [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) if not already installed!!!
2. Add your name & email in `.gitconfig`.
3. The path being exported in `.bash_profile` could be different for you so check! Update as needed.
4. If you have any other dotfiles you wish to be used upon startup of terminal add them [here](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/dotfiles/blob/master/README.md#18).

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/dotfiles.git
# save your dotfiles somewhere prior to moving my dotfiles to your home directory.

# Install Homebrew if you have not
# If you have Homebrew update brew.sh as needed and then:
source brew.sh

# and finally:
source .bash_profile
```

Remember this is a work in progress and more is coming!
