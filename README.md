Repository for holding all of my dotfiles.

## Disclaimer

## Don't forget too...

1. Run installation script for [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) if not already installed!!!
2. Add your name & email in `.gitconfig`.
3. Update `export` paths as needed in `.zshrc`.
## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/dotfiles.git
# save your dotfiles somewhere prior to moving my dotfiles to your home directory.

# Install Homebrew if you have not
# If you have Homebrew installed already:
brew bundle # all taps/formulae/casks/MacApps will be installed

# and finally:
source .zshrc
```
